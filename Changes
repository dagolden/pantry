0.006     2012-07-12 14:34:17 America/New_York

    [Added]

    - 'pantry create' now accepts 'host', 'port', and 'user'
      parameters that override the default SSH connection
      settings.

0.005     2012-05-11 13:25:40 America/New_York

    [Added]

    - Added support for Chef roles: creating, deleting, apply
      recipes, etc.  Chef roles may also be applied to node
      and role run_lists

    - Node and role names can often be abbreviated to
      a unique prefix, e.g. "foo" for "foo.example.com"

0.004     2012-05-04 16:01:12 America/New_York

    [Added]

    - 'pantry sync' downloads the node run-report to the 'reports'
      directory in the pantry.  This is useful for examining the
      state of the node and eventually may be useful for searching
      nodes based on configuration/state data.

    - 'pantry rename' command added to rename nodes

    - 'pantry delete' command added to delete nodes

    - pantry commands that take a single 'node NAME' target may
      specify a NAME of '-' to run the command against a list of
      names read from STDIN

    [Fixed]

    - 'pantry sync' was crashing due to Net::OpenSSH not working with
      Path::Class objects; fixed by stringifying paths before handing
      off to Net::OpenSSH

    [Changed]

    - node names (and data file paths) are always converted to lower case
      (since they are supposed to be DNS names, which are case insensitive
      anyway)

    - 'pantry list' outputs nodes alphabetically

0.003     2012-05-02 18:06:55 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - 'pantry list' now lists node *names* not *filenames*

0.002     2012-05-02 17:15:46 America/New_York

    [Added]

    - 'pantry apply' and 'pantry strip' commands added to support
      applying/stripping recipes and attributes for nodes at the command
      line instead of requiring an external editor

    - 'pantry list' command added to list nodes managed in a pantry

    - 'pantry show' command added to print out node JSON data

    [Fixed]

    - 'pantry sync' now includes the "--delete" flag during rsync

    [Changed]

    - pantry now uses model classes (Pantry::Model::*) to separate
      manipulation of pantry objects from the command line app
      interface
